# Minecraft Create Setup

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure you have and have run the official Minecraft Launcher, otherwise the stuff below won't work properly

## Install NeoForge

- Go to: https://neoforged.net/
- Change `Minecraft Version` dropdown to `1.21.1` before downloading
- Run the downloaded `.jar`
- Select `Install client` - keep default directory (should be `AppData/Roaming/.minecraft`)
- In Minecraft Launcher there should be a new installation called NeoForge - select it

## Install Create mod
- Go to: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create/files/7178775
- Hit download, make sure at the bottom you are downloading `Create 6.0.8 for mc1.21.1`
- Once installed go to your mods folder (in the installation folder from the NeoForge step, or just launch the game, go to `Mods` and `Open Mods Folder`)
- Copy downloaded mod jar file into the mods folder
- Launch the game and verify the mods are loaded (there'll be a few)

That's the lot
